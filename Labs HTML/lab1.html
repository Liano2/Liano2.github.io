<h1>All About Lian O.</h1>
	
<h3>Hey, my name is Lian and I'm a senior in High School at Bronx Early College Academy (BECA). I am learning how to use HTML's in class and how to understand them.</h3>

<h3>Some of my interests are watching TV in which my preferences are diversed, I like everything from sci-fi to musicals or from action to romance. Same thing goes for music, but reading became one of my favorite ways to pass time over the summer.</h3>
