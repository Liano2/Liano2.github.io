<h3>The earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt. Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE. They regularly placed cut flowers in vases, and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations. Flowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance.</h3> 

<h3>The lotus flower or water lily, for example, a, delphinium, narcissus, palm tree, papyrus and rose was considered sacred to Isis and was often included in arrangements. Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and garlands of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs. These are also included in the arrangements blue scilla, poppy-flowered anemone, and Iris sibiric. Egyptian wall paintings have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra's time.</h3></div>
