	<h2> My original image was a collage of potatoes because I couldn’t find any image that I liked for mashed potatoes. I choose this image because mashed potatoes is one of my favorite Thanksgiving food and in my opinion it goes with everything. I didn’t want to make my image too unrecognizable so I added a blue tint which made the image look like blue cells to me. We had to merge the layers and rotate vertically and horizontally many times until the images filled the page, creating a kaleidoscope. In the end I kept merging the layers together to create one single image with all the layers and this was my finshed product.</h2>
