	<h2> My original image was a collage of potatoes because I couldn’t find a pretty picture of mashed potatoes. I choose this image because mashed potatoes is my favorite Thanksgiving dish and it goes with everything. I didn’t want to make my image too unrecognizable so I added a blue tint which makes the image look like blue cells to me. We had to merge the layers and rotate vertically and horizontally many times until the images filled the page, creating a kaleidoscope. In the end I kept merging the layers together to create one single image with all the layers.</h2>
