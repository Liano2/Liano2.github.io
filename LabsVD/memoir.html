	<h2> I created a 6 word memoir composed of images that represent a quote that I choose from a book which was "Your now is not your forever" from Turtles All the Way Down. Taking images from newspapers, articles and magazines I created a memoir that represented my quote. I choose images that represented life and quotes about whow plans change. I know htat butterflies migrate so I decided to aldo add some in my memoir to show how we can move on in our lifes and a grain timer that I found in a news paper to show how time is running out. Overall, I really like how my memoir came out and I feel like it represents what I was trying to say. </h2>
