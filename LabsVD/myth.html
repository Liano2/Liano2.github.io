	<h2>To come up with the animals I first had the idea to create a pegasus so I added the wings of a dove and the body of a white horse, but then I wanted to add something different so I added the head of a deer which is one of my favorite animals which made the first creature look less realistic. Since this was my first image done I struggled with finding the right tools to use and how to cut out the unnecessary parts of the animal that I did not need since I did not find the object selection tool until I was doing my second mythical animal.  Once I was finally done there were no excess parts that I did not want, I merged all the layers together and added a background to be the setting for my animal and since it had wings I wanted a pretty sunset to be the setting. For the second animal, I wanted it to look like it popped out of the bottom of the screen, so I chose a Giraffe which has a long neck and gave it butterfly wings in the neck and some horns from some animal in Google which didnâ€™t have a name. It was easier to merge these animals together and cut them out with the object selection tool and I learned to put layers behind one another in the order that I want the animals to look like. In the end I also merged all those layers together and added the enemy (second mythological creature) with my first one and created the battle. </h2>
