	<h2> I chose this self-portrait because I liked the colors I chose for the images and I think it looks good. I struggled with the threshold because it was making my image either too dark or too light where you couldn't make out my face so I had to find a balance between the two and keep that number in mind for when making my other images. I didn’t want to use bright colors because I felt that soft colors might go more with my image so I chose pastel colors. When filling the image I think I missed a step because color my color picker tool wasn’t working correctly and it over filled the image with color instead of adding the color to the black portion of my image, in the end I did every step again and asked for help from my friend who was done with hers. I didn’t notice that the blue and the purple looked very similar but by that point I was already done and needed to work on other assignments. I turned my photos into a Pop Art style rendition by adding all four images in one layer and merging them next to each other also using the scale option in the transform drop down menu. </h2>
