	<h2> I created a campanula rapunculus flower with the shape design in Adobe Photoshop because it reminded me of the flower from Tangled which is one of my favorite movies. I first started with a yellow filling for the flower and purple borders to match the color theme in Tangled, after that I duplicated the layer and saturated the image to make it pink and put that flower at the bottom of the page while the yellow one was at the top. That was the start to then merging and duplicating and saturating the image twice and then rotating each one 15 degrees to the right each time. I wanted to stick with pastel colors so I made sure the color that the image was saturated to was one that I wanted and that would make the image look pretty. After having all the 4 colors I wanted, it was time to merge all the layers together and duplicate the image to scale it and make it smaller and turn it 15 degrees and continue that step making each layer smaller and smaller until the empty middle was done. I decided to leave a small circle space in the middle which made my image look less full than it really was. In the end it looked like my image was swirling into itself from the top and this was really fun to make and edit. </h2>
