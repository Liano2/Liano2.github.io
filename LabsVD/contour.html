	<h2> For my portrait I used a photo I took in class with the computer. I traced my own face with the freeform pen tool to outline my facial features, my mask, my sweater, hair and hands and after I did that I merged my layers to see it all together without the original picture. I picked a background from Google of one of my favorite colors and then added the text with the font that I wanted that says my name on top of my color background. I just added all the text in the same text box to make it easier on me to copy and paste and just press the Tab button to add a space in between. I then continued to see it all together and then erased any parts of the letters that were on my body with the eraser tool and had my finished results.</h2>
