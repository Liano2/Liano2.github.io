	<h2> My audience is people who like the forest and nature. It was hard to find the right shades of colors and most of the time I was making custom colors until I saw the color picker tool that helped me match the colors to each other. I chose this landscape because I just wanted something that was the same color and that represented nature and trees. I was thinking about how hard it is to trace over the small pieces of art in the picture.
