	<h2> My audience for this project was people who like the forest and nature. It was hard to find the right shades of colors that can match my image and most of the time I was making custom colors, until I noticed the color picker tool that helped me match the colors to each other. I chose this landscape because I just wanted something that had all the same shades of the smae color to be easier to trace and something that represented nature and trees. While tracing I had to zoom in to the smallest pixel in orer to make sure that I was not going ove the other colors with the wrong shade. In the end there were some spots that I missed but didn't notice until I was done with my image but it's very hard to see unless you look for it and my image turned out like the original which was my goal.</h2>
