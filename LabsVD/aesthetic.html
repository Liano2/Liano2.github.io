	<h2> In this project we had to create a collage that represented ourselfs. To my collage I added images taken from google and they were a statues, flowers in my favorite colors, my name, a sun, a bookcase and some soft shapes which are all things that I really like and I feel like represent me. Finding a spot for all the images to look good together was my biggest challenge since all the images had different height's and width's but in the end I decided to use a template which organized all the images for me and I just had to resize them to my liking. I added background color to show up behind the images and only be noticable where my name is written.</h2>
